# QEFS-A-Novel-Plant-Disease-Prediction-Approach-using-Quantum-Inspired-Evolutionary-Feature-Selection

## Overview


This project employs Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for feature extraction and a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HFSEA) for feature selection to improve plant disease prediction. The approach, termed Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Feature Selection (QEFS), aims to enhance model interpretability and computational efficiency.
